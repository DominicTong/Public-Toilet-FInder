## User Needs

### User stories
As a drunk person, or just someone out who needs to use the toilet in general, I would like to know the nearest toilet is so I can move on quickly to the next club or bar or party.
As a tourist, I would like to know these toilet locations in advance in order to plan my day out so I can alleviate possible stress from being in a foreign and unfamiliar city.
As someone out late at night, I would like to know these locations in order to have a safe space to retreat to if needed.
